* Changed the interface for `Runtime` and `ModelData` so that they function
  as single objects that manage large numbers of `XBlocks`. Any method that
  operates on a block now takes that block as the first argument. Blocks, in
  turn, are responsible for storing the key values used by their field scopes.

* Changed the interface for `model_data` objects passed to `XBlocks` from
  dict-like to the being cache-like (as was already used by `KeyValueStore`).
  This removes the need to support methods like iteration and length, which
  makes it easier to write new `ModelDatas`. Also added an actual `ModelData`
  base class to serve as the expected interface.
