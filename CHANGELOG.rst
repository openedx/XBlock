=========================
Change history for XBlock
=========================

These are notable changes in XBlock.

Unreleased
----------

1.10.0 - 2024-01-12
-------------------

* Add two new properties to ``XBlock`` objects: ``.usage_key`` and ``.context_key``.
  These simply expose the values of ``.scope_ids.usage_id`` and ``.scope_ids.usage_id.context_key``,
  providing a convenient replacement to the deprecated, edx-platform-specific block properties ``.location``
  and ``.course_id``, respectively.

1.9.1 - 2023-12-22
------------------

* Fix: add ``get_javascript_i18n_catalog_url`` missing ``xblock`` parameter to match the Open edX LMS
  XBlockI18nService.

1.9.0 - 2023-11-20
------------------

* Support for `OEP-58 JavaScript translations <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/concepts/oep58.html>`_:

  * Introduced abstract JavaScript translations support by adding the ``i18n_js_namespace`` property and
    ``get_i18n_js_namespace`` method to the ``SharedBlockBase``. This allows XBlocks to define a JavaScript namespace
    so the XBlock i18n runtime service can manage and load JavaScript translations for XBlocks.

  * Added the stub ``get_javascript_i18n_catalog_url`` method to the ``NullI18nService`` class to be implemented
    by runtime services.

  * See the `edx-platform atlas translations proposal <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/decisions/0019-oep-58-atlas-translations-design.rst>`_

1.8.1 - 2023-10-07
------------------

* Python Requirements Update
* Update setup.py, adds required packages

1.8.0 - 2023-09-25
------------------
* Added `xblock-utils <https://github.com/openedx/xblock-utils>`_ repository code into this repository along with docs.

  * Docs moved into the docs/ directory.

  * See https://github.com/openedx/xblock-utils/issues/197 for more details.

1.7.0 - 2023-08-03
------------------

* Switch from ``edx-sphinx-theme`` to ``sphinx-book-theme`` since the former is
  deprecated.  See https://github.com/openedx/edx-sphinx-theme/issues/184 for
  more details.
* Added support for Django 4.2

1.6.1 - 2022-01-28
------------------

* Fix Release Issue with PyPi release workflow

1.6.0 - 2022-01-25
------------------

* Dropped Django22, 30 and 31 support
* Added Django40 Support in CI


1.5.1 - 2021-08-26
------------------

* Deprecated the Runtime.user_id property in favor of the user service.

1.5.0 - 2021-07-27
------------------

* Added Django 3.0, 3.1 & 3.2 support

1.4.2 - 2021-05-24
------------------

* Upgraded all Python dependencies.

1.4.1 - 2021-03-20
------------------

* Added XBlockParseException exception.

1.3.1 - 2020-05-06
------------------

* Fixed import error of mock.

1.3.0 - 2020-05-04
------------------

* Drop support to python 2.7 and add support to python 3.8.
  typing package failing on py3.8 so add constraint.

1.2.8 - 2019-10-24
------------------

* Ensure the version file is closed after reading its content.

1.2.7 - 2019-10-15
------------------

* Changed how illegal XML characters are sanitized, to speed the operation.
  The old way was removing more characters than are required by the XML
  specification.

1.2.6 - 2019-09-24
------------------

* Add support for relative dates to DateTime fields.

1.2.5 - 2019-09-19
------------------

* Changes for Python 2/3 compatibility.

1.2.4 - 2019-08-27
------------------

* Added an API for notifying the Runtime when an XBlock's ``save()`` method is
  called.

* Added a mechanism for Runtime subclasses to more easily add extra CSS classes
  to the ``<div>`` that wraps rendered XBlocks

1.2.3 - 2019-07-24
------------------

Allow Mixologist class to consume both class objects and string paths to classes as a part of initialization.

1.2.1 - 2018-09-05
------------------

Add a method to get completion mode for a block.

1.2.1 - 2018-06-25
------------------

Suppress a spurious warning when using lazily-translated text as the default
value of a String field.

1.2.0 - Aside filtering
-----------------------

* Add capability for XBlockAsides to apply only to XBlocks that match certain conditions

1.0 - Python 3
--------------

* Introduce Python 3 compatibility to the xblock code base.
  This does not enable Python 2 codebases (like edx-platform) to load xblocks
  written in Python 3, but it lays the groundwork for future migrations.

0.5 - ???
---------

No notes provided.

0.4
---

* Separate Fragment class out into new web-fragments package

* Make Scope enums (UserScope.* and BlockScope.*) into Sentinels, rather than just ints,
  so that they can have more meaningful string representations.

* Rename `export_xml` to `add_xml_to_node`, to more accurately capture the semantics.

* Allowed `Runtime` implementations to customize loading from **block_types** to
  `XBlock` classes.

0.3 - 2014-01-09
----------------

* Added services available through `Runtime.service`, once XBlocks have
  announced their desires with `@XBlock.needs` and `@XBlock.wants`.

* The "i18n" service provides a `gettext.Translations` object for retrieving
  localized strings.

* Make `context` an optional parameter for all views.

* Add shortcut method to make rendering an XBlock's view with its own
  runtime easier.

* Change the user field of scopes to be three valued, rather than two.  `False`
  becomes `UserScope.NONE`, `True` becomes `UserScope.ONE`, and `UserScope.ALL`
  is new, and represents data that is computed based on input from many users.

* Rename `ModelData` to `FieldData`.

* Rename `ModelType` to `Field`.

* Split xblock.core into a number of smaller modules:

  * xblock.core: Defines XBlock.

  * xblock.fields: Defines ModelType and subclasses, ModelData, and metaclasses
    for classes with fields.

  * xblock.namespaces: Code for XBlock Namespaces only.

  * xblock.exceptions: exceptions used by all parts of the XBlock project.

* Changed the interface for `Runtime` and `ModelData` so that they function
  as single objects that manage large numbers of `XBlocks`. Any method that
  operates on a block now takes that block as the first argument. Blocks, in
  turn, are responsible for storing the key values used by their field scopes.

* Changed the interface for `model_data` objects passed to `XBlocks` from
  dict-like to the being cache-like (as was already used by `KeyValueStore`).
  This removes the need to support methods like iteration and length, which
  makes it easier to write new `ModelDatas`. Also added an actual `ModelData`
  base class to serve as the expected interface.
