# Version constraints for pip installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints

# latest botocore release cap upper version of python-dateutil<2.8.1, this conflicts
# with our dependencies due to the order in which the dependecies are pip-compiled.
# Adding this constraint till botocore can figure out a fix around this, keep a look at
# https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1872
