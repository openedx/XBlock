# Version constraints for pip installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints

# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# latest botocore release cap upper version of python-dateutil<2.8.1, this conflicts
# with our dependencies due to the order in which the dependecies are pip-compiled.
# Adding this constraint till botocore can figure out a fix around this, keep a look at
# https://github.com/edx/XBlock/pull/437
