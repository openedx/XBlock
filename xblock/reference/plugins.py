    Top-level definition for an XBlocks service.
    This is intended as a starting point for discussion, not a finished interface.

    Possible goals:

    * Right now, they derive from object. We'd like there to be a common superclass.
    * We'd like to be able to provide both language-level and service-level bindings.
    * We'd like them to have a basic knowledge of context (what block they're being
      called from, access to the runtime, dependencies, etc.
    * That said, we'd like to not over-initialize. Services may have expensive
      initializations, and a per-block initialization may be prohibitive.
    * We'd like them to be able to load through Stevedor, and have a plug-in
      mechanism similar to XBlock.

    This superclass should go somewhere else. This is an interrim location until we
    figure out where.

        This is a PROTOTYPE service for storing files in XBlock fields.

        It returns a file system as per:
          https://github.com/pmitros/django-pyfs

        1) The way this service is initialized and used is likely
        wrong. We'll want to fix it.
        2) There is discussion as to whether we want this service at
        all. Specifically:
        - It is unclear if XBlocks ought to have filesystem-as-a-service,
          or just as a field, as per below. Below requires an FS service,
          but it is not clear XBlocks should know about it.

        - It is unclear if pyfilesystem has performance properties we
          want.  Our goal is to try this in a limited roll-out, and see if
          whether we run into limitations, and if so, which ones. This is
          not intended as part of the XBlock standard until we've built up
