    The `user_state` scope is used to save data for one user, for one block, for one run
    of a course. An example might be how many points a user scored on one specific problem.

    The `preferences` scope is used to save data for one user, for all instances of one
    specific TYPE of block, across the entire platform. An example might be that a user
    can set their preferred default speed for the video player. This default would apply

    The `user_info` scope is used to save data for one user, across the entire platform. An
    example might be a user's time zone or language preference.
