Install the XBlock
******************

After you create the XBlock, you install it in the XBlock SDK.

In the ``xblock_development`` directory, use ``pip`` to install your XBlock.

   .. code-block:: none

      (xblock-env) $ pip install -e myxblock

You can then test your XBlock in the XBlock SDK.
