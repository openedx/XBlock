You build XBlocks that course teams use to create independent course components
that work seamlessly with other components in an online course. For example,
you can build XBlocks to represent individual problems, lessons, or course
sections. For more information, see :ref:`Tutorial Introduction to XBlocks`.

This part of the tutorial provides conceptual information about XBlocks that
all XBlock developers must understand.
