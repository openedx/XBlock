Now that you have created your XBlock skeleton, ``myxblock``, you need to make
it do something. This part of the tutorial explains modifying ``myxblock``; for
practical purposes, we will update it to match the `Thumbs XBlock`_ that is
installed with the XBlock SDK.

For more information about the Thumbs XBlock, see :ref:`Anatomy of an XBlock`

For more information about the different components of an XBlock, see
:ref:`XBlock Concepts`.
