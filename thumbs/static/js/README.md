# JavaScript Testing

This is an example of how to use 
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) to unit-test the
JavaScript used by the `thumbs` XBlock.

Since this is a small project, we use the stand-alone version
of Jasmine.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, open `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.

## Directory Structure

The tests are located in `spec/thumbs_spec.js`.

JavaScript dependencies such as JQuery are located in the `lib` folder.
`SpecRunner.html` handles loading these dependencies.
